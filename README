This is an example application of my blog post:

- Spring Data Solr Tutorial: Pagination - http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/solr/spring-data-solr-tutorial-pagination/

RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

- Download and install Maven 3 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation). If you have already installed Maven 3, you can skip this step.
- If you don't already have a local Solr installation, you have create one. You might want to read this
  blog entry: http://www.petrikainulainen.net/programming/maven/running-solr-with-maven/
- Go the root directory of project (The one which contains the pom.xml file)
- If you want to use the embedded Solr server, run command mvn clean jetty:run (Remember to set the value of
  solr.solr.home property found from the profiles/dev/config.properties file).
- If you want to use the HTTP Solr server, run command mvn clean jetty:run -P prod (Remember to set the value of
  solr.server.url property found from the profiles/prod/config.properties file).
- Start your browser and go to the location: http://localhost:8080
- Use credentials (user/password) to log in.

You can change the number of todo entries shown on a single page by modifying the js/app/app.js file (search
for TodoApp.Pagination)

RUNNING TESTS:

- You can run unit tests by using this command: mvn test -P dev
- You can run integration tests by using a command: mvn verify -P integration-test


problems:
1. IE9 third party login not works, window.opener is null after some redirection?,  test program works fine.
   - add hint in loginSuccess.jsp and add some logic for user to refresh ( actually login is done already, just to trigger the render )
closed: this problem doesnt exist anymore, note should install the self signed certificate as trusted ROOT ca.

2. should hide all the BACK button on cordova app and mobile browser.
closed.

3. how to build in the self keystore to cordova app
closed. ( dont need do this, only need add self-signed root CA, or need do nothing for commercial certificate )

4. anyway to get the local wifi ip in cordova app
   <gap:plugin name="com.albahra.plugin.networkinterface" version="1.0.7" />
closed. dont need do this way, root cause identified, android 4.4 use file:// which not accepted by tomcat.

5. improve 401 handling.

6. accepted complains job items appear in result list.
closed:  think more about that, this should be the correct behavior.
